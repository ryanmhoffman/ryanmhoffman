      <description>Cedar Gallery Cedar Gallery is a boutique, Tunisian, artisanal shop located in Fairlawn, Ohio. They sell beautiful, handmade goods imported from Tunisia. I recently had the pleasure of creating a website for Alex, the owner of Cedar Gallery, and that site is now live at www.cedarâ€‘gallery.com for you to go check out some of her products and find out more about her story!
Be sure to check back regularly because there are more exciting things in store for Cedar Gallery.</description>
